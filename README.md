# Scenario
- The user is spawned in a dungeon and there is a NPC wishing them luck on their journey telling them what to do, where they'll go through a portal and fight enemies, a boss, and collect chests for money for upgrades.

# Challenges faced and solutions
- Watching the video and understanding what was going on, as well as **why** we implement this code and how we structure everything. There were bugs like swing hitboxes, script issues that weren't linking, and portal wasn't teleporting to spawnpoint which I was able to fix after reviewing over the code.
