# Scenario
- The user is spawned in a dungeon and there is a NPC wishing them luck on their journey telling them what to do, where they'll go through a portal and fight enemies, a boss, and collect chests for money for upgrades.

# Challenges faced and solutions
- Watching the video and understanding what was going on, as well as why we implement this code and how we structure everything. There were bugs like swing hitboxes, script issues that weren't linking, and portal wasn't teleporting to spawn point which I was able to fix after reviewing the code.
